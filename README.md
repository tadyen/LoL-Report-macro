# LoL-Report-macro

AHK Macro to speed up the reporting process in LoL.

If you have an issue with this, you're probably part of the reason why this script was even made to begin with.

## Usage

Download and run the ahk script.

Options are kinda self explanatory ðŸ˜‰

## Known issues

- Can't rebind to Mouse Buttons eg MB4/MB5
- Msg doesn't accept exclamation marks (and probably any punctuation for the matter)
- (Should be fixed): Occasionally misses a few checkboxes
