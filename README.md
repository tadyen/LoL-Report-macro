# LoL-Report-macro

AHK Macro to speed up the reporting process in LoL.

If you have an issue with this, you're probably part of the reason why this script was even made to begin with.

## Requirements

[AutoHotkey v1.1](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

## Usage

Download and run the ahk script.

Options are kinda self explanatory üòâ

You need to be in the `Scoreboard` screen to use the macro.

Click the ‚ùó at the player ribbons to open the report screen.
Hitting the macro (default: F12) selects all the chosen checkboxes.

Using the Meta-Options, you can make it click the 'submit report' button automatically as well.

Use x10 mode to let the script autoclick every single ‚ùó and autosubmit them.
(I'm using mock-submits in the example below)

## Known issues

- Can't rebind to Mouse Buttons eg MB4/MB5
- Msg doesn't accept exclamation & punctuation marks (AHK automatically sanitises inputs)

## Potential upgrades

If i can ever bf'd, I could improve it with the following features in future:

- Pre-game lobby reporting option
- some option to avoid hitting your duo
