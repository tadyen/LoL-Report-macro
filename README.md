# LoL-Report-macro

AHK Macro to speed up the reporting process in LoL.

If you have an issue with this, you're probably part of the reason why this script was even made to begin with.

## Requirements

[AutoHotkey v1.1](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

## Usage

Download and run the ahk script.

Options are kinda self explanatory üòâ

You need to be in the `Scoreboard` screen to use the macro.

Click the ‚ùó at the player ribbons to open the report screen.
Hitting the macro (default: F12) selects all the chosen checkboxes.

Using the Meta-Options, you can make it click the 'submit report' button automatically as well.

Use x10 mode to let the script autoclick every single ‚ùó and autosubmit them.
(I'm using mock-submits in the example below)

## Known issues

- Can't rebind to Mouse Buttons eg MB4/MB5
- Msg doesn't accept exclamation & punctuation marks (AHK automatically sanitises inputs)

## Potential upgrades

If i can ever bf'd, I could improve it with the following features in future:

- Pre-game lobby reporting option
- some option to avoid hitting your duo

### Further Motivation

I, the author, believes that the report system (whether intentionally designed by the developers of League of Legends or not) strongly promotes toxicity and abuse. It is basic societal nature for disagreements to occur between different parties. Engagement and conflict, although naturally occuring, is not inherently toxic behaviour. However when one party is given power over another, mob-like and toxic behavious emerges (hehe Riots). This would actually be beneficial for such a game, as engineering conflict would keep engagement high and thus bring more activity and revenue into the game. However, this is currently in the realm of speculation and I do not have any evidence to support this claim. But here are the facts:
- Riot Games is a very small startup with very little funds and resources, and especially very limitted talent within the company
- Thus, Riot Games is in no capacity to really solve the problems and issues they have with their game and playerbase
- Riot Games could also realllllly benefit from a system that promotes engagement and activity to help their company and game grow
- The report system provides power towards a particular voice. Given two arbitrary opposing parties, A and B, who are in conflict. If the citizens of A-landia were given a tool to destroy the population of B-landia, and were the first to use it, the population and strength of B-landia would be reduced, and thus A-landia would be able to grow and prosper. This means A-landia would be given an unfair advantage over B-landia. A-landia would then be able to use said tool to further reduce B-landia. Even if B-landia were to retaliate, they would be at a disadvantage as A-landia has already used the tool to weaken them. This is the nature of the report system, and it is inherently toxic and abusive.
- Additionally, the report system has proven to be abusable. If enough people report a player, without any real cause or evidence, that player will be punished. This is mob justice (hehe Riot).
- Since the report system rewards the party with higher numbers, A-landia will always win against B-landia.
- The report system is also a threat that players have used to silence the opposing opinion. If a mob of players disagrees with another player, they can simply mass report them and the other player will be silenced.
- The threat of reporting only creates more strife between players, thus is an engineered form of conflict - which creates further engagement and activity within the game.
- Which again, Riot Games would benefit from, as they are a small startup with very little funds and resources, and especially very limitted talent within the company to solve the issue of toxicity and abuse within their game.
